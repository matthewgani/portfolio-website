installed tailwind
installed react icons for handburger
react scroll 


not done:
hooking up links to socials on the side bar
putting real portfolio items in and skills logos
maybe add night mode if its easy...
canva logo
insert my own data and re read whole website
change some section names
maybe change to react router if i wanna show blogs
    Please is there a way to use both react-scroll and react-router-don on one project cause I’m trying to have an info button on the work session which will lead to another page to tell a little about the projects but it isn’t working
    Sure can!  Just set your css to html {scroll-behavior: smooth}. Then when you link you would do something like this <a href=‘/#contact’.
