not done:
maybe add night mode if its easy...
canva my own logo
insert my own data and re read whole website
change color scheme
maybe change to react router if i wanna show blogs
    Please is there a way to use both react-scroll and react-router-don on one project cause I’m trying to have an info button on the work session which will lead to another page to tell a little about the projects but it isn’t working
    Sure can!  Just set your css to html {scroll-behavior: smooth}. Then when you link you would do something like this <a href=‘/#contact’.



IMPORTANT TO FIX:
1. jump to skills and projects not working well, i think bc i made skills div h-fit
  the skills / project tab cant all fit in 100vh i think.. 
  it is currently the way it is so that mobile / full screen wont get screwed up. at the cost of the kinda bad scroll to i guess.

  his skills is h-screen and work is md:h-screen 
(FIXED, only bad part is the section heights arent the same but all the jumps work properly)


2. need to change the tutorial guy's logo / remove it (DONE)

 > these 2 fixed by editing index.html
3. need to change the favicon and website tab name (its react app rn) (DONE)
4.  when sending link on whatsapp, the preview has description saying created by react app (DONE)


5. maybe add links to socials in footer
